- Admin panel option to "Reset to Clean State"
- Separate demo environment link

## Implementation Notes

The sample data should be:
- Realistic but clearly marked as demo
- Easy to identify and remove if needed
- Covering all major user workflows
- Professional and appropriate

## Recommendation: GO WITH SAMPLE DATA

This provides the best first impression and user experience for new deployments.
