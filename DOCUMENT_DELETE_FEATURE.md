# 🗑️ Document Delete Functionality Added

## ✅ What was implemented:

### Backend Changes:
1. **New DELETE endpoint** in `backend/routes/documents.js`:
   - `DELETE /api/documents/:id` 
   - Verifies user ownership (patient owns document OR user is doctor)
   - Deletes document from database
   - Also removes physical file from uploads folder
   - Returns success/error messages

### Frontend Changes:
2. **Enhanced UploadDocuments.jsx**:
   - Added delete state management (`deleting`)
   - Added `handleDelete()` function with confirmation dialog
   - Enhanced UI with better document cards showing:
     - Document title and upload date
     - View button (👁️ Shiko)
     - Delete button (🗑️ Fshi) with loading state
   - Auto-clear success messages after 5 seconds
   - Reset file input after successful upload

### Security Features:
3. **Authorization checks**:
   - Only document owner (patient) can delete their documents
   - Doctors can also delete documents (for clinic management)
   - Confirmation dialog before deletion
   - Loading states to prevent double-clicks

### User Experience:
4. **Improved interface**:
   - Better card layout instead of simple list
   - Upload date display
   - Clear visual separation between view/delete actions
   - Loading spinners during delete operations
   - Automatic message cleanup

## 🧪 Testing:

You can test the new functionality by:

1. **Upload a document** - use the form at the top
2. **View documents** - click "👁️ Shiko" to open in new tab  
3. **Delete documents** - click "🗑️ Fshi" and confirm

### Test script:
Run `node backend/scripts/list-documents.js` to see all documents in database.
